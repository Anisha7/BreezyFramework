TODO:
- Different theme css files and one basic css file
- import theme file above template file
- organize scss and css files separately
- start creating docs
- refactor code with all color themes
- decide on a color scheme for your framework site, create a side navbar and a way to render html stuff next to it based on navbar selection. (Add some JS)
